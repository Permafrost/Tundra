Networks] 7.1 and higher.

## Dependencies

[Tundra] is compiled for Java 1.6, and is dependent on the following
[webMethods Integration Server] packages:

* `WmFlatFile`
* `WmPublic`
* `WmRoot`

[Tundra] is also dependent on the following open source Java libraries, which
provide the underlying implementation for the majority of services, and are

## Installation

You have two choices for installing [Tundra]:

* `git`
* `zip`

If you are comfortable using git, I recommend this method as you can then
easily switch between package versions using git checkout and download new
versions using git fetch.

### Using Git

To install with this method, first make sure that:

* Git is [installed](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your Integration
  Server.
* Your Integration Server has internet access to https://github.com (for
  cloning the repository).
* The dependent packages listed above are installed and enabled on your
  Integration Server.
* You have identified what version of [Tundra] you'd like to install by
  referring to the available [releases].

From your Integration Server installation:

```sh
$ cd ./packages/
$ git clone https://github.com/Permafrost/Tundra.git
$ cd ./Tundra/
$ git checkout v<n.n.n> # where <n.n.n> is the required version
```

Then restart Integration Server to complete the installation.

### Using Zip

1. Download a pre-built zip of the desired version of the package from the
   available [releases].
2. Copy the `Tundra-vn.n.n.zip` file to your Integration Server's
   `./replicate/inbound/` directory.
3. Install and activate the [Tundra] package release `Tundra-vn.n.n.zip` from
   the package management web page on your Integration Server's web
   administration site.
4. Restart Integration Server to complete the installation.

## Upgrading

When upgrading you have to choose the same method used to originally install
the package. Unfortunately, if git wasn't used to install the package then
you can't use git to upgrade it either. However, if you want to switch to
using git to manage the package, delete the installed package and start over
using the git method for installation.

### Using Git

To upgrade with this method, first make sure that:

* Git is [installed](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your Integration
  Server.
* Your Integration Server has internet access to https://github.com (for
  fetching updates from the repository).
* The dependent packages listed above are installed and enabled on your
  Integration Server.
* You have identified what version of [Tundra] you'd like to upgrade to by
  referring to the available [releases].
* You originally installed [Tundra] using the git method described above.

From your Integration Server installation:

```sh
$ cd ./packages/Tundra/
$ git fetch
$ git checkout v<n.n.n> # where <n.n.n> is the desired updated version
```

Then restart Integration Server to complete the upgrade.

### Using Zip

1. Download a pre-built zip of the desired updated version of the package
   from the available [releases].
2. Copy the `Tundra-vn.n.n.zip` file to your Integration Server's
   `./replicate/inbound/` directory.
3. Install and activate the updated [Tundra] package release
   `Tundra-vn.n.n.zip` from the package management web page on your
   Integration Server's web administration site.
4. Restart Integration Server to complete the installation.

## Conventions

1. All input and output pipeline arguments are prefixed with `$` as a poor-
   man's scoping mechanism, since typically user-space variables are
   unprefixed.
2. All boolean arguments are suffixed with a `?`.
3. Single-word argument names are preferred. Where multiple words are
   necessary, words are separated with a `.`.
4. Service namespace is kept flat. Namespace folders are usually nouns.
   Service names are usually verbs, indicating the action performed on the
   noun (parent folder).
5. Services declare all inputs and outputs, always explicitly marked as
   optional or required, use constrained types where possible, and enable
   input and output pipeline validation, which minimises developer surprise.
6. Services often declare their inputs as optional, and either apply an
   appropriate default value, or take no action and return no output
   (whatever is more appropriate), to minimise the need for existence
   checking in flow map steps.
7. All private elements are kept in the `tundra.support` folder. All other
   elements comprise the public API of the package. As the private elements
   do not contribute to the public API, they are liable to change at any
   time. **Enter at your own risk.**

#### Inputs:

* `$condition` is the conditional statement to be evaluated. Conditional
  statements have the same form as when they are used in a flow branch
  step:

      condition = value comparison_op value [logical_op condition]
                | [!]value                  [logical_op condition]

  Where:
  * `value` is a fully-qualified percent delimited IData document key,
    such as `%a/b/c[0]%`, or a literal (double- or single-quoted) string,
    number, (forward slash delimited) regular expression, or `$null`.
  * `comparison_op` is one of the following comparison operators:
    * `=`
    * `==`
    * `!=`
    * `<>`
    * `>`
    * `>=`

---

### tundra.configuration:all

Returns all configuration settings for all configured packages.

#### Inputs:

  refresh of the cached configurations from disk. Defaults to
  `false`.

#### Outputs:

* `$configurations` is an `IData` document containing the configuration
  settings for each configured package.

---

### tundra.configuration:get

Returns the configuration settings associated with the given package.

This service supports the tiering of configuration settings across a
package-specific file and a server-specific file, where both files
are merged with the server-specific file taking precedence. This
approach allows for settings which are not environment-specific or
for default settings to be stored within the package itself, and for
other environment-specific settings or overridden settings to be
stored in a configuration file specific to an Integration Server
instance. Note that if this is not required, a single file can still
be used.

Package-specific settings are loaded from the following file:

    ./packages/<package>/config/package.<format>

Server-specific settings are loaded from the following file:

    ./config/packages/<package>.<format>

Where `<package>` is the name of the package in question, and
`<format>` is one of the following supported file extensions:

File Extension | File Format
-------------- | --------------------------------------------
hjson          | [Hjson]
json           | [JSON]
properties     | Java properties
values         | IData or Values encoded XML
xml            | Aribtrary or IData or Values encoded XML
yaml           | [YAML]

Package configurations are cached lazily in memory: read first from
disk on the initial invocation, and then returned from an in-memory
cache thereafter.

Prior to a configuration being cached in memory, variable
substitution `%key%` substrings found in configuration values are
automatically substituted as follows:

* Keys prefixed with `$system` are resolved against the `$system`
  document returned by `tundra.system:reflect`.

This approach allows for server-specific global configuration values
stored as environment variables, java system properties, or global
variables to be included in the returned package configurations.
Note that because the variable substitution occurs when the
configuration is first read from disk and cached (to optimise
performance), changes to environment variables, java system
properties, or global variables will not be reflected in the
returned package configurations until those configurations are
refreshed from disk.

#### Inputs:

* `$package` is the optional name of the package whose configuration
  is to be returned. If not specified, the package is automatically
  inferred from the invoking service.
* `$refresh?` is an optional boolean which when `true` will force a
  refresh of the cached configuration from disk. Defaults to `false`.

#### Outputs:

* `$package` is the name of the package whose configuration was
  returned.
* `$configuration` is an `IData` document containing the configuration
  settings for the given package.

---

### tundra.configuration:list

Returns all configuration settings for all configured packages.

#### Inputs:

* `$refresh?` is an optional boolean which when true will force a
  refresh of the cached configurations from disk. Defaults to
  `false`.

#### Outputs:

* `$configurations` is an `IData[]` document list containing the
  configuration settings for each configured package.

---

### tundra.content:amend

Edits the given content with the list of key value pairs specified in
`$amendments` by first parsing the content, replacing the values
associated with the given keys with those in `$amendments`, and then

#### Inputs:

* `$content` is a string, byte array, or input stream containing the
  content to be amended.
* `$amendments` is an IData document list containing all the edits to be
  made to the given `$content`.
  * `key` is a fully-qualified (for example, `a/b/c[0]`) key identifying
    the value in the parsed `$content` to be edited.
  * `value` is the value to be assigned to the item identified by key,
    and can include percent-delimited variable substitution strings
    which will be substituted prior to being inserted into the parsed
    `$content`.
  * `condition` is an optional `Tundra/tundra.condition:evaluate`
    conditional statement, which is evaluated against the pipeline and
    only if the condition evaluates to true will the associated amended
    value be applied. If not specified, the amended value will always be
    applied.
* `$content.type` is the MIME media type that describes the format of the
  given `$content`.
* `$namespace` is a list of namespace prefixes and the URIs they map to,
  used when parsing and emitting [XML] content with elements in one or
  more namespaces.
* `$schema` is the fully-qualified name of the document reference or flat
  file schema to use when parsing `$content`.
* `$encoding.input` is an optional character set used to decode the text
  data if `$content` is provided as a byte array or input stream.
  Defaults to [UTF-8].
* `$encoding.output` is an optional character set used to encode the
  amended text data if `$mode.output` is a byte array or input stream.
  Defaults to [UTF-8].
* `$mode.output` is an optional choice of stream, bytes, or string which
  specifies the type of object `$content` is returned as. Defaults to
  stream.

---

### tundra.content:deliver

Delivers arbitrary content specified as a string, byte array, input
stream, [org.w3c.dom.Node] object, or `IData` document to the given
destination [URI].

Additional delivery protocols can be implemented by creating a
service named for the [URI] scheme in the folder
`Tundra/tundra.content.deliver`. Services in this folder should
implement the `Tundra/tundra.schema.content.deliver:handler`
specification.

#### Inputs:

* `$content` is a string, byte array, input stream, [org.w3c.dom.Node]
  object, or `IData` document containing data to be delivered to the
  `$destination` [URI].

  If `$content` is provided as an `IData` document, it will be serialized
  using an emitter determined in order of precedence by `$schema` and
  `$content.type`. If `$schema` is specified, the type of reference
  determines the emitter to use: a document reference will use the
  [XML] emitter, a flat file schema reference will use the Flat File
  emitter. If `$schema` is not specified, `$content.type` is used to
  determine the most appropriate emitter for the MIME media type in
  question. If neither `$schema`, nor `$content.type` are specified,
  `$content` is serialized as [XML] by default.
* `$content.type` is an optional MIME media type that describes the
  format of the given content.
* `$namespace` is an optional list of namespace prefixes and the URIs
  they map to, used when emitting and `IData` document as [XML]
  content with elements in one or more namespaces.
* `$schema` is an optional fully-qualified name of the document
  reference or flat file schema used to serialize `$content` when
  provided as an `IData` document.
* `$encoding` is an optional character set to use when `$content` is
  provided as a string or `IData` document which is used to encode the
  text data for delivery. Defaults to [UTF-8].
* `$destination` is a [URI] identifying the location where the given
  `$content` should be delivered. If not specified, no delivery will be
  attempted. Supports the following delivery protocols / [URI] schemes:
  * `file`: writes the given content to the file specified by the
    destination [URI]. The following additional override options can
    be provided via the `$pipeline` document:
    * `$filename`: the name of the file to be written. This value will
      override the value provided in the destination [URI].
    * `$mode`: append / write
  * `ftp`: uploads the given content to the FTP server, directory and
    file specified by the destination [URI]. An example FTP [URI] is
    as follows:

        ftp://aladdin:opensesame@example.com:21/path/file?append=true&active=true&ascii=true

    The following additional override options can be provided via
    the `$pipeline` document:
    * `$user`: the username used to log in to the FTP server.
      Defaults to the username specified in the authority section of
      the [URI].
    * `$password`: the password used to log in to the FTP server.
      Defaults to the password specified in the authority section of
      the [URI].
    * `$active`: a boolean which when `true` indicates that the
      connection to the FTP server should be in active mode.
      Defaults to `false` (passive mode).
    * `$append`: a boolean which when `true` will append the given
      content to the file, rather than overwrite it, if the file
      already exists. Defaults to `false` (overwriting).
    * `$ascii`: a boolean which when `true` indicates that the file

This service is intended to be invoked by clients via HTTP or FTP.

---

### tundra.content:retrieve

Retrieves arbitrary content from the given `$source` URI, and calls the
given content processing service to process it.

Additional retrieval protocols can be implemented by creating a service
named for the URI scheme in the folder `tundra.content.retrieve`.
Services in this folder must implement the
`tundra.schema.content.retrieve:handler` specification.

#### Inputs:

* `$source` is a URI identifying the location from which content is to be
  retrieved. Supports the following retrieval protocols / URI schemes:
  * `file`: processes each file matching the given `$source` URI with the
    given processing `$service`. The file component of the URI can
    include wildcards or globs (such as `*.txt` or `*.j?r`) for matching
    multiple files at once.

    The following example would process all `*.txt` files in the
    specified directory:

        file:////server:port/directory/*.txt

    To ensure each file processed is not locked or being written to by
    another process, the file is first moved to a working directory. The
    name of this directory can be configured by adding a query string
    parameter called working to the URI, for example:

        file:////server:port/directory/*.txt?working=temp

    In this example, files are first moved to a subdirectory named
    `temp`. If not specified, the working directory defaults to a
    subdirectory named `working`.

    After successful processing, the file is then moved to an archive
    directory. The name of this directory can be configured by adding a
    query string parameter called archive to the URI, for example:

        file:////server:port/directory/*.txt?archive=backup

    In this example, files are moved to a subdirectory named `backup`
    after being successfully processed. If not specified, the archive
    directory defaults to a subdirectory named `archive`.

    Optionally, archived files older than a given age can be cleaned up
    automatically by the retrieve process by specifying a query string
    parameter called `purge` with an XML duration value representing the
    age an archived file must be before being purged, for example:

        file:////server:port/directory/*.txt?purge=P14D

    In this example, any files in the archive directory older than 14
    days will be automatically deleted by the retrieve process. If the
    query string parameter `purge` is not specified, archived files will
    not be automatically cleaned up.
* `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the content processing
  service, which implements the
  `tundra.schema.content.retrieve:processor` specification, invoked to
  process each item of content retrieved from the `$source` URI.
* `$limit` is an optional maximum number of content matches to be
  processed in a single execution. Defaults to 1000, if not specified.

---

### tundra.content.retrieve:file

The file protocol handler for the `Tundra/tundra.content:retrieve`
service, which retrieves file content for files matching the given
`$source` URI and calls the given `$service` content processing service
to process each file.

Implements the `Tundra/tundra.schema.content.retrieve:handler`
specification.

        }
      },
      "e": "example 3",
      "f": ["example 4", "example 5"]
    }

Keys using path-style notation, for example `a/b/c`, are
converted to nested IData documents with the final key
in the path, `c` in this example, assigned the value of
the original key.

    `post`, `head`, `put`, `delete`, `options`, or `trace`. Defaults to `get`.
  * `content` is a string, byte array, input stream, or `IData`
    document used as the body of the request. If an `IData` document
    is specified for a get request, the elements are encoded as
    query string parameters in the request [URI]. If an `IData`
    document is specified for a post or put request, the elements
    are encoded as form parameters in the request body.
  * `encoding` is an optional character set used to encode the given
    content if provided as a string.
  * `authority` are optional credentials for the request.
  * `headers` are the [HTTP] headers sent with the request.

### tundra.http.route:list

Returns a list of all the custom HTTP routes currently in effect.

#### Outputs:

* `$routes` is an `IData[]` document list containing all the directives
  which have been registered with the Integration Server HTTP
  request dispatcher, and the associated custom routing
  instructions.
  * `directive` is the first directory or folder in a URI path, and
    is used by the Integration Server HTTP request dispatcher for
    dispatching requests to the appropriate handler. Note that
    there are a number of built-in directives in Integration
    Server, which are prohibited from being overridden by custom
    routes:
    * `invoke`
    * `soap`
    * `web`
    * `wm-message`
    * `ws`
  * `routes` is an `IData[]` document list of the custom HTTP routing
    instructions associated with this directive in order of
    precedence.
    * `method` is the [HTTP request method] used to match this HTTP
      routing instruction to incoming HTTP requests, and is one of:
      * `get`
      * `put`
      * `post`
      * `head`
      * `connect`
      * `options`
      * `delete`
      * `trace`
    * `uri` is the [URI template] used to match this HTTP
      routing instruction to incoming HTTP requests. Parameters
      specified in the template will be captured against the
      incoming HTTP request URI, and added to the input pipeline
      of the resulting `service` invocation. For example:

          /messages/{client}/{type}

      Will add the variables `client` and `type` to the input pipeline
      of the resulting `service` invocation, with their values
      derived from the matched request URI. A request URI equal to:

          /messages/foo/bar

      will set the input pipeline variables as follows:

          client = "foo"
          type   = "bar"

    * `target` is either the fully-qualified name of a service that
      is invoked, or a URL for a DSP page or static asset in the
      pub directory of a package that will be returned, when an
      incoming HTTP request matches the associated `method` and `uri`.
    * `description` is an optional description of the the HTTP
      routing instruction.
    * `source` is the HTTP route file name from which this routing
      instruction was configured.
  * `routes.length` is the number of routes associated with this
    directive.
* `$routes.length` is the number of directives registered with the
  Integration Server HTTP dispatcher for custom HTTP routing.

---

### tundra.http.route:refresh

Reloads all configured custom HTTP routes from the server- and
package-specific configuration files.

Custom HTTP routes specify an [HTTP request method] and [URI
template] which, if matched by an Integration Server HTTP request,
will return the associated target (either by invoking the target if
it is a service in the same way as the built-in `/invoke` URIs work,
or by returning a DSP page or static asset if the target is not a
service), and can be used to abstract the API used by HTTP clients
from the implementation (unlike `/invoke` URIs or package DSP pages
URIs, which leak the implementation in the URI's path).

Custom HTTP routes can either be configured in a server-specific
configuration file, or a package-specific configuration file.

To register a server-specific custom HTTP route, create or edit the
`<IntegrationServer>/config/http-routes.cnf` file, using the
`<IntegrationServer>/packages/Tundra/config/http-routes.example.cnf`
file as a template.

To register a package-specific custom HTTP route, create or edit the
`<IntegrationServer>/packages/<PackageName>/config/http-routes.cnf`
file, using the
`<IntegrationServer>/packages/Tundra/config/http-routes.example.cnf`
file as a template.

Note that server-specific HTTP routes take precedence over package-specific
routes, and package-specific routes are loaded in lexical package name
order. Routing instructions inside each configuration file must be
specified in order of precedence, and all HTTP routes are aggregated into
a single routing table in Integration Server, and therefore care must be
taken so that routes specified across the various configuration files do
not override each other.

Changes to these HTTP route configuration files do not take effect
until this service is invoked, either manually or by reloading the
Tundra package.

---

### tundra.id:generate

Generates an immutable universally unique identifier ([UUID]). A [UUID]
represents a 128-bit value.

There exist different variants of these global identifiers. The methods
of this class are for manipulating the Leach-Salz variant, although the
constructors allow the creation of any variant of [UUID] (described below).

The layout of a variant 2 (Leach-Salz) [UUID] is as follows: The most
significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:

  0xFFFFFFFF00000000 time_low
  0x00000000FFFF0000 time_mid
  0x000000000000F000 version
  0x0000000000000FFF time_hi

The least significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:

  0xC000000000000000 variant
  0x3FFF000000000000 clock_seq
  0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFF node

The variant field contains a value which identifies the layout of the
[UUID]. The bit layout described above is valid only for a [UUID] with a
variant value of 2, which indicates the Leach-Salz variant.

The version field holds a value that describes the type of this [UUID].
There are four different basic types of UUIDs: time-based, DCE
security, name-based, and randomly generated UUIDs. These types
have a version value of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

For more information including algorithms used to create UUIDs,
see the Internet-Draft UUIDs and GUIDs or the standards body
definition at ISO/IEC 11578:1996.

#### Inputs:

Returns a new `IData[]` document list with all fully qualified keys (for
example, 'a/b/c' or 'x/y[0]/z[1]') deconstructed into their constituent
parts, and any non-IData objects converted to an IData representation
wherever possible.

For example, if an `IData` document contains the following key value pairs
(using [JSON] notation to represent the pipeline):

    {
      "a/b/c": "example 1",
      "a/b/d": "example 2",
      "e": "example 3",
      "f[0]": "example 4",
      "f[1]": "example 5"
    }

This is normalized to the following:

    {
      "a": {
        "b": {
          "c": "example 1",
          "d": "example 2"
        }
      },
      "e": "example 3",
      "f": ["example 4", "example 5"]
    }

Keys using path-style notation, for example `a/b/c`, are
converted to nested `IData` documents with the final key
in the path, `c` in this example, assigned the value of
the original key.

Keys using array- or list-style notation, for example `f[0]`,
are converted to an array or list with the value of the
original key assigned to the indexed item (the zeroth item in
this example).


#### Inputs:

* `$list` is an `IData[]` document list to be normalized.

#### Outputs:

* `$list` is the resulting normalized `IData[]` document list.

---

### tundra.list.document:nullify

in the given `IData[]` document list to null.

#### Inputs:

* `$list` is an `IData[]` document list to be nullified.
* `$recurse?` is an optional boolean indicating if embedded
  `IData` documents and `IData[]` document lists should also
  be nullified. Defaults to `false`.

#### Outputs:

* `$list` is the resulting `IData[]` document list with all string
  values that contain only whitespace characters converted to
  null.

---

### tundra.list.document:pivot

Returns a given `IData[]` document list pivoted on a given list of
keys.

For example, given an `IData[]` document list that includes the
following two items (represented in [JSON] form):

    $list = [
      { "id": "1", "name": "Bob",  "phone": "1234 5678" },
      { "id": "2", "name": "Jane", "phone": "2345 6789" }
    ]

A pivot on the key `name` would return the following `IData` document,
where each list item is now associated with the value associated
with the pivot key:

    $document = {
      "Bob":  { "id": "1", "name": "Bob",  "phone": "1234 5678" },
      "Jane": { "id": "2", "name": "Jane", "phone": "2345 6789" }
    }

A pivot on the key `phone` would return the following `IData` document:

    $document = {
      "1234 5678": { "id": "1", "name": "Bob",  "phone": "1234 5678" },
      "2345 6789": { "id": "2", "name": "Jane", "phone": "2345 6789" }
    }

A pivot on both the keys `id` and `name` would return the following
`IData` document (note that the pivot keys are nested):

    $document = {
      "1": {
        "Bob":  { "id":"1", "name":"Bob",  "phone":"1234 5678" }
      },
      "2": {
        "Jane": { "id":"2", "name":"Jane", "phone":"2345 6789" }
      }
    }

Alternatively, a pivot on both the keys `id` and `name` with a delimiter
of `-` would construct a compound key using the values associated with
each key from each item joined with the given delimiter, as follows:

    $document = {
      "1-Bob":  { "id":"1", "name":"Bob",  "phone":"1234 5678" },
      "2-Jane": { "id":"2", "name":"Jane", "phone":"2345 6789" }
    }

Although the difference between the `IData[]` document list and `IData`
document representations appear subtle, a pivot of a `IData[]`
document list on a primary key returns an `IData` document that can be
efficiently accessed by key, rather than having to iterate over the
list to find a specific item by key.

#### Inputs:

* `$list` is the `IData[]` document list to be pivoted.
* `$keys` is the list of keys to pivot on, with the following
  caveats:
  * If a key doesn't exist in an item, that item is not included
    in the resulting pivot.
  * If a key is associated with a null value in an item, that item
    is not included in the resulting pivot.
  * If a key is associated with the same value in multiple items,
    only the first item is included in the resulting pivot.
* `$delimiter` is an optional character to use for separating the
  values that form a compound key, when multiple pivot keys are
  specified. If not specified, the pivot keys will be nested in
  the returned `IData` document. The delimiter `/` is reserved,
  and will also result in the pivot keys being nested.

#### Outputs:

* `$document` is the `IData` document pivoted representation of the
  given `$list`.

---

### tundra.list.document:prepend

* `$list` is the resulting list with the item at the given
  index set to the given value.

---

* `$condition` is a `tundra.condition:evaluate` compatible
  conditional statement used to filter the given list.

  List items are represented in the evaluation scope by
  a variable named `$item`.

  where surname and firstname keys have specific values,
  use the following `$condition`:

      %$item/surname% == "Smith" and %$item/firstname% == "John"

* `$scope` is an optional IData document containing the
  variables against which `$condition` will be evaluated.

whose recognition condition evaluates to true against the pipeline
is returned.

Message formats are registered by including the following
configuration section in a `tundra.configuration:get` compatible
package configuration file:

    "tundra/message/format": [
        {
            "name": "Example 1",
            "description": "An example message format",
            "type": "text/xml",
            "namespace": {
                "cn": "http://example.com/common",
                "sh": "http://example.com/shared"

            },
            "enabled": true
        }
    ]

Refer to `tundra.schema.message:format` for further details on the
structure of a message format.

formats specified across all package configuration files whose names
are unique. It is expected, but not required, that message formats
are mutually exclusive.

#### Outputs:

* `$message.recognized?` is a boolean which when `true` indicates that a
  message format was recognized against the given pipeline.
* `$message.format` is returned when `$recognized?` is `true` and is the
  first registered message format whose recognize condition matched
  the pipeline.

Message formats are registered by including the following
configuration section in a `tundra.configuration:get` compatible
package configuration file:

    "tundra/message/format": [
        {
            "name": "Example 1",
            "description": "An example message format",
            "type": "text/xml",
            "namespace": {
                "cn": "http://example.com/common",
                "sh": "http://example.com/shared"
            },
            "recognize": {

            },
            "parse": {
                "ref": "schema.example:document"
            },
            "validate": {
                "ref": "schema.example:document"
            },
            "route": {
                "type": "publish",
                "ref": "schema.example:document"
            },
            "enabled": true
        }
    ]

Refer to `tundra.schema.message:format` for further details on the
structure of a message format.

The total set of registered message formats is the set of all
formats specified across all package configuration files whose names
are unique. It is expected, but not required, that message formats
are mutually exclusive.

---

### tundra.message:receive

Receives arbitrary content and routes it to either the webMethods
messaging subsystem via `pub.publish:publish`, a JMS destination,
or a direct service invocation.

The content can be specified as a string, byte array, `IData` document,
`java.io.InputStream`, or `org.w3c.dom.Node` object.

This service is either intended to be invoked directly by clients
via HTTP or FTP, or it can be wrapped by another service which
specifies appropriate pipeline variables to control the routing of
the content.

When invoked via HTTP, the service returns a 'text/plain' response
body that is empty on success, or contains a message describing the
errors that occurred on failure, and an appropriate HTTP response
code according to the following table:

Response                   | Reason
---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
202 Accepted               | Received content was routed successfully
400 Bad Request            | Received content was malformed
403 Forbidden              | Sender was denied access to route the received content
406 Not Acceptable         | Received content was not recognized (Unknown)
409 Conflict               | Received content was detected as a duplicate
422 Unprocessable Entity   | Received content failed validation
500 Internal Server Error  | All other errors that occur while processing

When invoked via transports other than HTTP, for example FTP, if the
content is received successfully the service invocation will succeed
and an empty response body is returned. If a security or any other
exception is encountered, the service invocation will fail by
rethrowing the exception.

When invoked by a wrapping service, any exceptions encountered will
be thrown to the calling service. It is then the calling service's
responsibility to set an appropriate response for the transport in
question.

Refer to `tundra.message.format:recognize` for further details on how
message formats are recognized by this service.

---

### tundra.message:retrieve

Retrieves arbitrary content from the given `$source` URI, and routes
it to either the webMethods messaging subsystem via
`pub.publish:publish`, a JMS destination, or a direct service
invocation.

Additional retrieval protocols can be implemented by creating a
service named for the URI scheme in the folder
`Tundra/tundra.content.retrieve`.  Services in this folder must
implement the `Tundra/tundra.schema.content.retrieve:handler`
specification.

#### Inputs:

* `$source` is a URI identifying the location from which content is to
  be retrieved. Supports the following retrieval protocols / URI
  schemes:
  * `file:` routes each file matching the given `$source` URI according
    to the routing specified by the recognized message format. The
    file component of the URI can include wildcards or globs (such
    as *.txt or *.j?r) for matching multiple files at once.

    The following example would process all *.txt files in the
    specified directory:

        file:////server:port/directory/*.txt

    To ensure each file processed is not locked or being written to
    by another process, the file is first moved to a working
    directory. The name of this directory can be configured by
    adding a query string parameter called working to the URI, for
    example:

        file:////server:port/directory/*.txt?working=temp

    In this example, files are first moved to a subdirectory named
    temp. If not specified, the working directory defaults to a
    subdirectory named `working`.

    After successful processing, the file is then moved to an archive
    directory. The name of this directory can be configured by
    adding a query string parameter called archive to the URI, for
    example:

        file:////server:port/directory/*.txt?archive=backup

    In this example, files are moved to a subdirectory named backup
    after being successfully processed. If not specified, the
    archive directory defaults to a subdirectory named `archive`.

    Optionally, archived files older than a given age can be cleaned
    up automatically by the retrieve process by specifying a query
    string parameter called purge with an XML duration value
    representing the age an archived file must be before being
    purged, for example:

        file:////server:port/directory/*.txt?purge=P14D

    In this example, any files in the archive directory older than
    14 days will be automatically deleted by the retrieve process.
    If the query string parameter purge is not specified, archived
    files will not be automatically cleaned up.

* `$message.format.name` is an optional message format name which if
  specified will skip the recognition step and instead use the
  format with the given name when routing.
* `$limit` is an optional maximum number of content matches to be
  processed in a single execution. Defaults to `1000`.

---

### tundra.message:route

Routes arbitrary content to either the webMethods messaging
subsystem via `pub.publish:publish`, a JMS destination, or a direct
service invocation.

`java.io.InputStream`, or `org.w3c.dom.Node` object.

#### Inputs:

* `$content` is arbitrary content specified as a string, byte array,
  `IData` document, `java.io.InputStream`, or `org.w3c.dom.Node` object.
* `$message.format.name` is an optional message format name which if
  specified will skip the recognition step and instead use the
  format with the given name for routing.

* `$key` is a simple or fully-qualified (such as `a/b/c[0]/d`) key
  identifying the value to be converted to a list.
* `$scope` is an optional `IData` document that, if specified, is used
  to resolve the given `$key` against. If not specified, `$key` is
  resolved against the pipeline.

#### Outputs:

* `$scope` is returned if an input `$scope` was provided, where the value
  identified by `$key` within it has been converted to a list. If
  no input `$scope` was specified, the value identified by `$key` in the
  pipeline is instead converted to a list. If `$key` does not identify
  any value, this service does nothing.

---

### tundra.object:nothing

Returns null.

#### Outputs:

* `$nothing` is returned with a null value.

---

### tundra.object:reflect

Returns whether the given object is an array, a primitive type or an

* `$key` is an optional key identifying the value in the pipeline to
  relect on, and can be simple or fully qualified, such as `a/b/c[0]/d`.
  Use `$key` instead of `$object` when reflecting on an object that could

  fully qualified, such as `a/b/c[0]/d`.
* `$key.literal?` is an optional boolean flag which if true will treat the
  given keys literally rather than as potentially fully-qualified keys.
  Defaults to false if not specified.

---

### tundra.pipeline:denormalize

Replaces all nested child elements in the pipeline with non-nested
elements whose keys are fully-qualified.

For example, if the pipeline contains the following key value pairs
(using [JSON] notation to represent the pipeline):

    {
      "a": {
        "b": {
          "c": "example 1",
          "d": "example 2"
        }
      },
      "e": "example 3",
      "f": ["example 4", "example 5"]
    }

This is denormalized to the following:

    {
      "a/b/c": "example 1",
      "a/b/d": "example 2",
      "e": "example 3",
      "f[0]": "example 4",
      "f[1]": "example 5"
    }

---

### tundra.pipeline:drop

Drops the key value pair associated with the given key from the pipeline.

#### Inputs:

* `$key` identifies the key value pair to be dropped, and can be simple or

* `$content` is an input stream, byte array, or string (depending on
  the `$mode` selected) representing the encoded pipeline data.

---

### tundra.pipeline:first

Returns the first key value pair from the pipeline.

#### Outputs:

* `$key` is the first key in the pipeline.
* `$value` is the first key's associated value.

---

### tundra.pipeline:flatten

Returns the values associated with the given keys from the pipeline
flattened to a one-dimensional array.

For example, given the following pipeline containing a single `IData`
document `a` (represented in [JSON] form):

    {
      "a": [
        {
          "b": [
            {
              "c": "1"
            },
            {
              "c": "2"
            },
            {
              "c": "3"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "b": [
            {
              "c": "4"
            },
            {
              "c": "5"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

A flattening of `a/b/c` would return the following (represented in
[JSON] form):

    ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]

A flattening of `a/b[0]/c` would return the following (represented
in [JSON] form):

    ["1", "2", "3"]

And a flattening of `a/b[0]/c[0]` would return the following
(represented in [JSON] form):

    ["1"]

#### Inputs:

* `$keys` is a list of fully-qualified keys identifying the values in
  the pipeline to be flattened. If the keys index multiple nested
  arrays all associated values in those arrays will be flattened
  into the returned one-dimensional array.
* `$nulls?` is an optional boolean flag which when `true` will include
  missing or null values as nulls in the resulting array. Defaults
  to `false`.

#### Outputs:

* `$values` is a one-dimensional array containing the flattened values
  associated with the given `$keys` in pipeline.

---

### tundra.pipeline:get

if it doesn't exist.

Also supports resolving [XPath] expressions against [org.w3c.dom.Node]
objects in the top level of the pipeline.

#### Inputs:

* `$key` identifies the value to be retrieved from the pipeline, and can be
  simple or fully qualified, such as `a/b/c[0]/d`.

  given `$key` does not exist or its associated value is null.
* `$default.string` is an optional string value, provided for convenience
  when hard-coding a default value, to be returned when either the given
  `$key` does not exist or its associated value is null.

#### Outputs:

* `$value` is the value associated with the given `$key`.

  are to be copied directly into the pipeline.

---

### tundra.pipeline:normalize

Iterates over each element in the pipeline, deconstructing
all fully qualified keys into their constituent parts.

For example, if a pipeline contains the following key value
pairs (using [JSON] notation to represent the pipeline):

    {
      "a/b/c": "example 1",
      "a/b/d": "example 2",
      "e": "example 3",
      "f[0]": "example 4",
      "f[1]": "example 5"
    }

This is normalized to the following:

    {
      "a": {
        "b": {
          "c": "example 1",
          "d": "example 2"
        }
      },
      "e": "example 3",
      "f": ["example 4", "example 5"]
    }

Keys using path-style notation, for example "a/b/c", are
converted to nested IData documents with the final key
in the path, "c" in this example, assigned the value of
the original key.

Keys using array- or list-style notation, for example "f[0]",
are converted to an array or list with the value of the
original key assigned to the indexed item (the zeroth item in
this example).

pipeline by replacing all occurrences of substrings matching
"%key%" with the associated value.

---

### tundra.schedule:create

Schedules a service for execution once or periodically.

The resulting scheduled task ID is added to the input pipeline
of the scheduled service as a variable named `$schedule.id`,
enabling the service itself to query its owning scheduled task.
This can be useful if, for example, the service implements an
[event loop] and should exit that loop if its owning schedule
is paused or cancelled.

#### Inputs:

* `$schedule` is an IData document representing the task to be
  scheduled.
  * `type` describes the type of schedule to be created, and is
    a choice of the following:
    * `once` will schedule the service to execute one time only
      at the given `start` datetime.
    * `repeat` will schedule the service to execute periodically
      at the given `repeat/interval` of time.
    * `complex` will schedule the service to execute periodically
      on the given minutes, hours, week days, days of month, and
      months of the year.
  * `service` is the fully-qualified name of the service to be
    scheduled for execution.
  * `description` is an optional description of the scheduled task.
  * `target` optionally identifies the server or servers to execute
    the service on. Either specify a specific `hostname:port` to
    execute the service on, or one of the following values:
    * `$any` executes the task on any server in the cluster. Choose
      this option to ensure the service is only executed once at
      any one time, but can be executed by any server in the cluster.
    * `$all` execute the task on all servers in the cluster. Choose
      this option when the service needs to be executed on every
      cluster node at the same time to perform, for example, clean
      up or house keeping on every server.

    If not specified, will default to `$any` if the server is a
    member of a cluster, otherwise will default to execution on
    the server creating the scheduled task.
  * `user` is the optional user account under which the service will
    be executed. If not specified, the service will execute under
    the `Default` user account context.
  * `start` is the optional datetime from which the scheduled task
    will be in effect or active. If not specified, defaults to the
    current datetime. For `once` only tasks, this is the datetime
    the service will be executed once and only once.
  * `end` is the optional datetime after which the scheduled task
    will no longer be in effect (expires). If not specified, the
    schedule will never expire. Not applicable for `once` scheduled
    tasks.
  * `overlap?` is an optional boolean determining how to handle when
    one execution of the scheduled task overlaps the next scheduled
    execution, for example when the execution duration exceeds the
    schedule interval.

    When true, the next scheduled execution of the service will
    execute as per the schedule, even if the previous schedule is
    still executing, which can result in multiple concurrent
    executions of the service.

    When false, the schedule will never be executed concurrently.
    For a repeat schedule, the next scheduled time is calculated
    from the end of execution of the previous schedule. For a complex
    schedule, any scheduled times that occur while the previous
    schedule is executing are skipped, and the service will execute
    at the next uncontested scheduled time.
  * `lateness` is an optional IData document containing arguments for
    how to determine when, and then handle if, a schedule is late.
    * `duration` is an optional duration of time which when lapsed
      passed the scheduled time determines that the task is considered
      late. If not specified, defaults to 0 seconds (in other words a
      task is considered late if it doesn't execute exactly at its
      scheduled time).
    * `action` is an optional choice which determines what happens to
      the task when its determined to be late:
      * `run immediately`
      * `skip and run at next scheduled interval`
      * `suspend`

      If not specified, defaults to `run immediately`.
  * `repeat` is an optional IData document containing arguments only
    applicable when the schedule type is `repeat`.
    * `interval` is an optional [XML] duration determining how often
      the scheduled task will execute. If not specified, defaults to
      `PT60S` (60 seconds).
  * `complex` is an optional IData document containing arguments only
    applicable when the schedule type is `complex`.
    * `months` is an optional list of months of the year, provided as
      an integer between 1 (January) and 12 (December), the schedule
      should execute in. If not specified, the schedule will execute

  * `ref` is the document reference or schema reference to be used to
    validate content in this message format.
* `route`
  * `type` is the type of routing to be performance, and is a choice
    of (currently only publish is supported):
    * `publish` routes the message to the webMethods messaging
      subsystem via `pub.publish:publish` using the `documentTypeName`
      specified in `ref`.
    * `jms` routes the message to a JMS destination specified in `ref`.
    * `service` routes the message via a direct service invocation of
      the service specified in `ref`.

### tundra.security.content:digest

Returns a message digest for the given content using the given
algorithm. A message digest is a secure one-way fixed-length hash
of arbitrary data.

  how the calculated digest is returned. Defaults to `stream`.

#### Outputs:

* `$content` is the given content which was used to calculate the
  digest, and can now be further processed. The reason this is
  returned is that when an input stream is provided calculating
  the message digest necessarily requires consuming the stream,
  therefore a new input stream is instead returned, positioned at
  the start of the data stream and ready for further consumption.
  This allows a message digest to be calculated in advance of normal
  processing of an input stream.
* `$digest` is the calculated message digest for the given content,
  returned either as a byte array, input stream, or base64-encoded
  string, depending on the `$mode` chosen.

  other words, the invocation is scoped to this IData document. If
  not specified, the invocation is unscoped, and hence the service
  will operate directly against the pipeline itself.
* `$count` is the number of times `$service` will be invoked, and must
  be greater than or equal to 1. The more times `$service` is
  invoked, the more reliable the resulting statistics will be (in
  other words, the more samples the better).
* `$raise?` is an optional boolean flag which when `true` will halt the
  benchmark immediately upon encountering the first exception thrown by
  `$service`, and rethrows it. Defaults to `false`.

#### Outputs:

* `$duration.average` is the calculated mean or average duration of
  execution of the given service with the given input pipeline
  formatted as an [ISO8601] XML duration string.
* `$duration.standard.deviation` is the calculated standard
  deviation duration of execution of the given service with the
  given input pipeline formatted as an [ISO8601] XML duration
  string.

  in invocation order with the top-level service as the
  first item.
* `$callers` is a string representation of the call stack,
  which is useful for diagnostics/logging.

  tundra.service:callstack, which is useful for obtaining
  the name of the service which called the currently
  executing service.

---

### tundra.service:create

Creates a new empty flow service with the given name in an existing
package.

#### Inputs:

* `$package` is the name of the existing package in which to create
  a new empty flow service. If the package does not exist, an
  exception will be thrown.
* `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the service to be
  created, such as `folder1.folder2:service3`. If an element with
  the given name already exists, an exception will be thrown.

---

### tundra.service:defer

Defers execution of the given service using a dedicated single thread. The
service is not executed immediately, and is instead queued to wait to be
executed until the defer thread becomes available.

#### Inputs:

* `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the service to be deferred.
* `$pipeline` is an optional IData document which, if specified, contains
  the input arguments for the invocation of `$service`; in other words, the
  invocation is scoped to this IData document. If not specified, the
  invocation is unscoped, and hence the service will operate directly
  against the pipeline itself.

---

### tundra.service:ensure

Provides a try/catch/finally pattern for flow services.

#### Inputs:

* `$service` is the fully-qualified name of a service invoked
  in the [try block].
* `$catch` is an optional fully-qualified name of a service
  invoked in the [catch block]. This service should
  implement the `Tundra/tundra.schema.exception:handler`
  specification. If no `$catch` service is specified, the
  exception will be rethrown.
* `$finally` is an optional fully-qualified name of a service
  invoked in the [finally block] (always invoked regardless
  of whether an exception is thrown by `$service` or not).
* `$pipeline` is an optional IData document which, if specified,
  contains the input arguments for the invocations of `$service`,
  `$catch`, and `$finally`; in other words, the calls to these
  services are scoped to this IData document. If not specified,
  the invocations are not scoped, and hence these services
  operate directly against the pipeline itself.

#### Outputs:

* `$pipeline` is the output pipeline of the invocations of
  `$service`, `$catch`, and `$finally`. This is only returned if
  `$pipeline` was specified as an input. Otherwise, the outputs
  of these invocations are merged directly with the pipeline
  itself.

---

### tundra.service:initiator

Returns true if the calling service is the initiating top-level
service for this thread.

#### Outputs:

* `$initiator?` is a boolean indicating if the calling service

---

### tundra.service:invoke

Invokes a service either synchronously or asynchronously, and
either scoped or unscoped.

#### Inputs:

* `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the service to be
  invoked.
* `$pipeline` is an optional IData document which, if specified,
  contains the input arguments for the invocation of `$service`;
  in other words, the invocation is scoped to this IData document.
  If not specified, the invocation is unscoped, and hence the
  service will operate directly against the pipeline itself.
* `$mode` is an optional choice of execution mode: either synchronous
  or asynchronous. When synchronous, the invocation of
  `Tundra/tundra.service:invoke` blocks until the invocation of
  `$service` completes. When asynchronous, `Tundra/tundra.service:invoke`
  returns immediately and the invocation of `$service` occurs on another
  thread.

#### Outputs:

* `$pipeline` is the output pipeline of the invocation of
  `$service`. This is only returned if the `$mode` is synchronous,
  and the invocation was scoped (`$pipeline` was specified as an
  input). If the invocation was synchronous and unscoped, the
  outputs of the invocation are merged directly with the pipeline
  itself. If the invocation was asynchronous, then no outputs
  are returned.
* `$thread` is returned only when the invocation `$mode` is asynchronous,
  and is the thread object which can later be waited on to finish
  using `Tundra/tundra.service:join`.

---

### tundra.service:join

Waits for the given service thread to finish before returning the
service output pipeline.

#### Inputs:

* `$thread` is a service thread object returned by
  `Tundra/tundra.service:invoke` when a service is invoked
  asynchronously.

---

### tundra.service:respond

Forces the specified response status and body to be returned by webMethods
Integration Server to the calling process (such as an HTTP or FTP client).
This service only works correctly when invoked by the top-level initiating
service of the current thread, an unfortunate limitation of the platform.

Unlike WmPublic/pub.flow:setResponseCode, which throws an exception when
invoked for transports other than HTTP, this service succeeds regardless
of the invoking transport.

#### Inputs:

* `$code` is the [HTTP status code] for the returned response. For
  example, a 200 status code indicates the request was successful.
  For transports other than HTTP, a status code >= 400 will result
  in an exception being thrown. This is the appropriate response,
  as it will result in the correct action for those transports
  occurring (a SOAP fault for a SOAP invocation, a file transfer
  failure for an FTP invocation, etc).
* `$message` is an optional message to be associated with the given
  status code. If not specified, the standard status message for
  the code will be used. This is only applicable to HTTP transports.

  keys and values to be added to the response. This is only applicable
  to HTTP transports.
* `$content` is an optional string, byte array, or input stream
  containing the response body to be returned. If not specified,
  defaults to an empty string.
* `$content.type` is the mime type of the given response body content. If
  not specified, defaults to application/octet-stream (the mime type for
  arbitrary binary data).
* `$encoding` is an optional character set used to encode $content when
  specified as a string. Defaults to [UTF-8].

---

### tundra.service:self

Returns the name of the current service, or nothing if invoked
directly.

cease execution) for the specified duration, subject to the
precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers.

#### Inputs:

* `$duration` is an [ISO8601] XML duration for which the
  current thread should sleep.

system resources.

#### Inputs:

* `$stream` is an optional [java.io.InputStream] or
  [java.io.OutputStream] object to be closed. If specified, the stream
  is closed and any associated system resources are released. If not
  specified, this service does nothing.

---

### tundra.string:capture

Returns the associated [capturing groups] if the given [regular expression
pattern] is found anywhere in the given string.

Refer to the following excerpt from the [java.util.regex.Pattern]
documentation:

> Groups and capturing
>
> Capturing groups are numbered by counting their opening parentheses from
> left to right. In the expression `((A)(B(C)))`, for example, there are four
> such groups:
>
> 1. `((A)(B(C)))`
> 2. `(A)`
> 3. `(B(C))`
> 4. `(C)`
>
> Group zero always stands for the entire expression.
>
> Capturing groups are so named because, during a match, each subsequence of
> the input sequence that matches such a group is saved. The captured
> subsequence may be used later in the expression, via a back reference, and
> may also be retrieved from the matcher once the match operation is
> complete.
>
> The captured input associated with a group is always the subsequence that
> the group most recently matched. If a group is evaluated a second time
> because of quantification then its previously-captured value, if any, will
> be retained if the second evaluation fails. Matching the string "aba"
> against the expression `(a(b)?)+`, for example, leaves group two set to "b".
> All captured input is discarded at the beginning of each match.
>
> Groups beginning with `(?` are pure, non-capturing groups that do not
> capture text and do not count towards the group total.

    represents a single [capturing group]. Note that the first (zeroth)
    item in the list always denotes the entire pattern.
    * `captured?` is a boolean flag which when true indicates that this
      [capturing group] was captured in the matched substring. This flag
      will be false for optional [capturing groups] that are not found in
      the matched substring.
    * `index` is the zero-based start index of the captured substring for
      this [capturing group], and is only specified when `$captured?` is

    list, which is equal to the number of [capturing groups] + 1 (where
    the additional item is the entire pattern) present in the [regular
    expression pattern].

  pattern] was found in the given `$string`, and the number of items in
  the `$captures` `IData[]` document list.

    Supports absolute keys prefixed with `/`, which will always be
    resolved against `$pipeline`, if it exists, or the pipeline itself,
    if it does not exist. If not specified, then a value should be
    provided directly in the value field. The following two special
    keys are also supported with their values set automatically when
    used:
    * `$index` is the zero-based index of the item in $list being

    the [java.util.Formatter format string] conversions available to
    the argument:
    * `string` will convert the value to a `java.lang.String` prior to
      formatting.
    * `integer` will convert the value to a `java.math.BigInteger` prior
      to formatting.
    * `decimal` will convert the value to a `java.math.BigDecimal` prior
      to formatting.
    * `datetime` will convert the value to a `java.util.Calendar` prior

Where brackets (...) delineate optional components and the characters
':', '?', and '#' stand for themselves.

Hierarchical URIs are constructed according to the following syntax:

    (scheme:)(//authority)(/path/)(file)(?query)(#fragment)

Where the characters ':', '/', '?', and '#' stand for themselves. The
authority component, if specified, can be either server-based or
registry-based. If server-based, it is constructed according to the
syntax:

    (user:password@)host(:port)

For example, the following components represented using [JSON]:

    {
      "scheme": "http",
      "authority": {
        "server": {
          "user": "bob",
          "password": "secret",
          "host": "example.com",
          "port": "8080"
        }

  * `query` is an optional IData document whose elements are the set
    of [URI] query string key value parameters. Lists are supported
    in query strings as follows: `?a=1&a=2&a=3` is parsed to a
    `String[] = { "1", "2", "3" }`.
  * `fragment` is the optional fragment component of the [URI].

#### Outputs:

* `$string` is the resulting [URI] input string.

---

### tundra.uri:encode

URI encodes (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) a string, according
to [RFC 2396].

The following rules are applied in the conversion:

* The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0"
  through "9" remain the same.
* The special characters ".", "-", "*", and "_" remain the same.
* The plus sign "+" is converted into a space character " " .
* A sequence of the form "%xy" will be treated as representing a byte
  where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the 8 bits. Then,
  all substrings that contain one or more of these byte sequences
  consecutively will be replaced by the character(s) whose encoding would
  result in those consecutive bytes. The encoding scheme used to decode
  these characters may be specified, or if unspecified, the default
  encoding of the platform will be used.

Implemented with the [java.net.URLEncoder] class.

#### Inputs:

* `$string` is a string containing data to be URI-encoded.
* `$encoding` is the character set used to obtain the bytes for unsafe
  characters. Defaults to [UTF-8].

---

### tundra.uri:normalize

Normalizes a URI string.

Refer to the following excerpt from the [java.net.URI normalize] method for
a description of the normalization process:

> If this URI is opaque, or if its path is already in normal form, then this
> URI is returned. Otherwise a new URI is constructed that is identical to
> this URI except that its path is computed by normalizing this URI's path
> in a manner consistent with RFC 2396, section 5.2, step 6, sub-steps c
> through f; that is:
>
> 1. All "." segments are removed.
>
> 2. If a ".." segment is preceded by a non-".." segment then both of these
>    segments are removed. This step is repeated until it is no longer
>    applicable.
>
> 3. If the path is relative, and if its first segment contains a colon
>    character (':'), then a "." segment is prepended. This prevents a
>    relative URI with a path such as "a:b/c/d" from later being re-parsed
>    as an opaque URI with a scheme of "a" and a scheme-specific part of
>    "b/c/d". (Deviation from RFC 2396.)
>
> A normalized path will begin with one or more ".." segments if there were
> insufficient non-".." segments preceding them to allow their removal. A
> normalized path will begin with a "." segment if one was inserted by step
> 3 above. Otherwise, a normalized path will not contain any "." or ".."
> segments.

#### Inputs:

* `$string` is the [URI] to be normalized.

#### Outputs:

* `$string` is the given [URI] in normalized form.

---

### tundra.uri:parse

Parses a Uniform Resource Identifier ([URI]) string, according to
[RFC 2396], to its constituent parts.

URIs can be categorized as either hierarchical, where the scheme and body
parts are separated by the character sequence '://', or opaque, where the
scheme and body parts are separated by a ':' character.

Examples of hierarchical URIs:
* http://example.com/
* ftp://example.com/path/file.txt

Examples of opaque URIs:
* mailto:john.doe@example.com
* news:comp.lang.java
* urn:isbn:096139210x

Opaque URIs are constructed according to the following syntax:

    (scheme:)body(?query)(#fragment)

Where brackets (...) delineate optional components and the characters
':', '?', and '#' stand for themselves.

Hierarchical URIs are constructed according to the following syntax:

    (scheme:)(//authority)(/path/)(file)(?query)(#fragment)

Where the characters ':', '/', '?', and '#' stand for themselves. The
authority component, if specified, can be either server-based or registry-
based. If server-based, it is constructed according to the syntax:

    (user:password@)host(:port)

Where the characters '@' and ':' stand for themselves.

Opaque URI bodies are not subject to further parsing, however, to
accomodate the mailto: URI's use of a query string for additional data
(such as cc, bcc, subject, and body), this service checks if the body
contains a query string and, if so, parses the query string also.

For example, the following [URI]:

    http://bob:secret@example.com:8080/x/y/z/index.html?a=1&a=2&b=3&c%5B0%5D=4&c%5B1%5D=5&d%2Fe=6#footer

    {
      "scheme": "http",
      "authority": {
        "server": {
          "user": "bob",
          "password": "secret",
          "host": "example.com",
          "port": "8080"
        }
      },
      "path": ["x", "y", "z"],
      "file": "index.html",
      "query": {
        "a": "1",
        "a": "2",
        "b": "3"
,
        "c": ["4", "5"],
        "d": {
          "e": "6"
        }
      },
